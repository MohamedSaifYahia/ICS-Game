## Description
Intro to CS: The Game is an engaging and visually captivating space-themed arcade game built using Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. This game is designed to offer both entertainment and a subtle educational undertone, encouraging players to dodge obstacles, battle bosses, and collect knowledge points (KP) and bug fixes (Bugs) to progress through various levels, each presenting unique challenges and enemies.

- **Item Collection:** Players can collect Bugs for bug fixes and KP (Knowledge Points) for in-game currency, used to purchase upgrades or recover health.
- **Upgrades and Health Management:** Through interactions with characters (e.g., Professor Potsch and Hazem), players can purchase upgrades, recover health, or buy additional ammo using KP.
